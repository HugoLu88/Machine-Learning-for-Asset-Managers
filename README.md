# Machine-Learning-for-Asset-Managers
ML for AM by Marcos Lopez de Prado

If, like me, you learn best by doing, then this workbook is for you. Where Lopez de Prado excellently provides code snippets, 
unfortunately I could not find one that was simply “Copy-pasteable” for any given section. 
Therefore in growing more acquainted with the concepts in his book, I have debugged and collated the code contained within.

The code needs few adjustments, but some found relate to deprecated methodologies and functions that are either mis-referenced or named slightly differently throughout the book.

Examples:

xrange changed to range
print x changed to print(x)

getDistDSR function on pp. 112
